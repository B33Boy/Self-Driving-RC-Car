 
Problem Definition: The model will predict the correct keypress to move the car given a live video feed.

Inputs: list of 120x320 images (unrolled), list of 1x5 one-hot-encoded labels that determine the direction to turn

Type of problem: multiclass single-label classification where each input image should be categorized into one of the following: [1 0 0 0 0], [0 1 0 0 0], [0 0 1 0 0], [0 0 0 1 0], [0 0 0 0 1]

Metric: accuracy

Evaluation protocol: Validation Accuracy


Because the problem is a multiclass single-label classification problem, our last layer activation function is softmax, and our loss function is binary cross-entropy
